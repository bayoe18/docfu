# ==============================================================================
# DocFu Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# Place docfu.yml files at the root of your documentation source directory
# or any subdirectory.
#
# Configuration sections:
# - site: Site name, URL, and theme (required in root docfu.yml)
# - workspace: Build workspace directory (default: .docfu/workspace)
# - dist: Build output directory (default: .docfu/dist)
# - assets: Static assets directory (default: assets)
# - components: Custom components directory (default: components)
# - exclude: Files/directories to omit from processing
# - unlisted: Files/directories to exclude from search (but still build)
# - sidebar: Navigation structure (auto-generated if omitted)
#
# Hierarchical configuration:
# - docfu.yml files can exist in any directory
# - Configs are processed in alphabetical order
# - More specific configurations override less specific ones
# - Avoid duplicate configuration entries to prevent conflicts
# ==============================================================================
